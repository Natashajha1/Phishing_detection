**Real-Time Detection of Phishing Sites via Transparent Multi-Stage Analysis and OCR-Based Integrity Check**

A capstone project designed to tackle phishing threats through a secure, interpretable, and real-time web-based detection pipeline using hybrid structural + visual signals.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

**SecURL** is a real-time phishing detection system built to address limitations in traditional blacklists and opaque machine learning models. It implements a two-phase detection architecture:

- **Phase 1** â€” Structural and contextual checks using domain tokens, HTML title parsing, SSL certificate analysis, and favicon hashing.
- **Phase 2** â€” Visual verification using headless browser rendering, OCR via Google Vision API, and TF-IDF keyword validation.

## ðŸ›  Features

- Detects zero-day phishing websites
- Transparent decision-making with interpretable logic
- Visual-semantic branding verification (OCR + TF-IDF)
- Secure webpage rendering in isolated VM environment
- Defenses against shared infrastructure, cloaking, and SSL spoofing
- Lightweight web UI for real-time analysis

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

> Ensure you're running on a system with Python 3.8+ and a virtualization environment (e.g., VirtualBox or VMware).

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Natashajha1/Phishing_detection.git

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Google Custom Search
export GOOGLE_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
export SEARCH_ENGINE_ID="your_search_engine_id"

# Google Vision API
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS='path_to_your_gcp_credentials.json'

(Optional but recommended) Set up Linux Mint Virtual Machine
Use VirtualBox/VMware to isolate the browser rendering process. This increases security against drive-by-downloads and cloaked phishing pages.
